# Eating-snake
A snake eating game purely developed using HTML,CSS and javascript.


This game is purely developed using HTML,CSS and Javascript where we have a snake which can be controlled using the keyboard keys and it is similar to childhood nokia snake eating game where our objective is to score as much as possible by eating blocks


With each block the size of snake is increased by 1 and we need to take care of not hitting the walls or the body of the snake itself and score as big as possible. We even maintained a varible which stores our high score until now in this game. To make it even more interesting the speed of the snake increases with progress in game.
